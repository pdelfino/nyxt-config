# What is Nyxt?

Nyxt is a keyboard-oriented, infinitely extensible web browser designed for power users. Conceptually inspired by Emacs and Vim, it has familiar key-bindings (Emacs, vi, CUA), and is fully configurable in Lisp.

## Why do you like Nyxt?
 
Nyxt is pretty cool in my opinion and I intend to produce more content about it. I did this first [prototype/pilot video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yBjfjFE0fk) about what is Nyxt and why I like it so much.  I also intend to write more texts like [this](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/enable-mode.org).

## Why sharing your Nyxt config files?

Besides recording videos and writing articles about Nyxt, sharing config files is another way of spreading the word about the project. Reading config files from other Nyxt's users helped me to build my own configuration. It was a little bit tricky specially due to Common Lisp package notation.

## What is your approach to your config files?

I am still new to the Nyxt universe. Thus, I am tacking a minimalistically approach. The out-of-box configuration is already pretty good.

In my case, I was missing two things: google search as an option and *some* keybindings from Emacs. I could have migrated to the Emacs or Vim mode (I actually did for awhile. But I would rather stay in the default mode changing just what I was missing.

## Do you recommend other configuration files?

Yes.  Artyom Bologov (@aartake) has a more thorough and complex [config file](https://github.com/aartaka/nyxt-config). In addition, you can also check out John Mercouris (@jmercouris) [config files](https://discourse.atlas.engineer/t/my-lightweight-configuration/47/6) directly from the Nyxt community forum. Both of them are from the developer team. Actually, John is one of the co-founders of the project. 

On Nyxt's forum, there is even an especific tag for posts about config files called [**configuration expos√®**](https://discourse.atlas.engineer/c/nyxt/configuration-expose/8). May the power of Nyxt be with you :)
